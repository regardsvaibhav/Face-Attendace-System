# Madhya Pradesh Police Tracking System:

Installation Guide Welcome to the Madhya Pradesh Police Tracking System! This advanced AI-based facial recognition and attendance management system is designed to streamline and automate the attendance process. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the necessary steps to install and set up the system on your local machine.

Prerequisites Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.7+ The code is written in Python 3, so ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

pip (Python Package Installer) pip is the package manager for Python. Ensure that you have the latest version installed. You can upgrade pip using:

bash Copy code python -m pip install --upgrade pip 3. Additional Tools Some packages, like OpenCV, require additional tools to be installed.

CMake: Required for building OpenCV from source. Download and install CMake from here.

Visual Studio (Windows-only): If you're on Windows, you will need Visual Studio with C++ build tools to compile OpenCV. You can download Visual Studio from here.

Step-by-Step Installation Step 1: Clone the Repository First, you’ll need to clone the GitHub repository that contains the code.

bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link.git cd your-repository-folder Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended) Setting up a virtual environment will help you manage the dependencies without affecting the global Python installation.

bash Copy code python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate' Step 3: Install Required Libraries You can either use a requirements.txt file (if provided) or install the necessary libraries manually.

Option 1: Using requirements.txt Create a file named requirements.txt in the project folder with the following contents:

txt Copy code streamlit opencv-python face_recognition numpy pandas plotly pillow Now, install the dependencies with this command:

bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt Option 2: Manually Installing Libraries If the requirements.txt is not available, manually install the necessary libraries using the following command:

bash Copy code pip install streamlit opencv-python face_recognition numpy pandas plotly pillow Library Details Here’s a breakdown of the essential libraries used in the system:

Streamlit: Used for creating the interactive web application where you can manage and track attendance.

Installation: pip install streamlit Streamlit Documentation OpenCV: This library handles image processing, capturing video input, and performing facial recognition tasks.

Installation: pip install opencv-python OpenCV Documentation face_recognition: A powerful library for face detection and recognition. It compares uploaded images to detect known faces.

Installation: pip install face_recognition face_recognition Documentation NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is used for handling and manipulating image data as arrays.

Installation: pip install numpy NumPy Documentation Pandas: This library is used for managing and manipulating attendance data in CSV format.

Installation: pip install pandas Pandas Documentation Plotly: Used to generate interactive plots and data visualizations for attendance analytics.

Installation: pip install plotly Plotly Documentation Pillow: Pillow is a fork of Python Imaging Library (PIL). It handles image operations such as opening, manipulating, and displaying images in Streamlit.

Installation: pip install pillow Pillow Documentation Additional Notes Image Directory Setup Make sure to create a folder named ImagesAt in your project directory. This folder should contain the images of individuals whose attendance will be recorded.

Attendance File The system will automatically generate an Attendance.csv file in the working directory to store attendance records. This file will be created upon the first attendance entry.

Camera Setup The system uses your webcam to capture video feed and perform facial recognition. Ensure that your camera is connected and accessible.

Running the Application Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the application with the following command:

bash Copy code streamlit run Prime_Main.py This will launch the Streamlit app in your default web browser, where you can interact with the tracking system.

Troubleshooting Face Recognition Issues: If you encounter issues with the face_recognition library (e.g., due to missing dependencies or CMake errors), make sure you have installed the required tools like CMake and Visual Studio (for Windows users).

Webcam Access: Ensure your system allows webcam access for the Python script. If you’re using Streamlit, you may need to grant permissions.

Conclusion With these steps, you’ll be able to set up the Madhya Pradesh Police Tracking System on your machine. This system leverages facial recognition technology to efficiently manage attendance for police personnel.
